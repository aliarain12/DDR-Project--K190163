As we discuss in the meeting we discuss about problem statement of our project "SERVANT DESIGN PATTERN".
In software engineering, the servant pattern is a design pattern in which a class (the servant) provides a unified interface to perform tasks for its clients that delegate to the servant. The servant class typically has a wide range of responsibilities and communicates with other classes to perform the tasks required by its clients. The idea behind the servant pattern is to decouple the clients from the specific implementation details of the tasks they need to perform, allowing the clients to focus on their core responsibilities and the servant to handle the details of how the tasks are actually carried out. This can make it easier to modify the behavior of the system by changing the servant class without affecting the clients, and can also help to improve the testability and maintainability of the system.
